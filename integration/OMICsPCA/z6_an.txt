choice	graphical output	console output	function used	package	additional arguments
1	Barplot of variance explained by each principal component (PC) or dimension	Table of eigen values and corresponding variance	fviz_eig	factoextra	addlabels
2	Loadings (in terms of cos2, contrib or coord supplied through the argument var_type) of columns/variables (cell lines in this example) on PC1 and PC2	Table of loadings in terms of coord, cos2 or contrib as supplied through the argument var_type	fviz_pca_var	factoextra	var_type
3	Matrix plot of correlations of each column/variable (Cell line in this example) with each PC	Table of correlations of variables (Cell lines) with PCs/Dimensions	corrplot	factoextra and corrplot	is.corr
4	Barplot of squarred loadings (or cos2) of each column/variable (cell line in this example) on the PC/dimension of choice	Table of squarred loadings/cos2 of each variable (Cell line) on the PCs/ Dimensions	fviz_cos2	factoextra	PC
5	The contributions of each column/variable (cell line in this example) in accounting for the variability in a given PC/dimension. The contribution (in percentage) is calculated as : squared loading of the variable (e.g. a cell line) * 100 / total squared loading of the given PC/dimension	Table of contribution of each variable on the selected PC/Dimension	fviz_contrib	factoextra	PC
